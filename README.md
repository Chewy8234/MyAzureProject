# Blazor Starter Application
// Sebastian  Campos

https://mango-plant-0ff9e230f.azurestaticapps.net/

This template contains an example [Blazor WebAssembly](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-3.1#blazor-webassembly) client application, a C# [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) and a C# class library with shared code.

## Getting Started

Create a repository from the [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.22/user/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) and then clone it locally to your machine.

Once you clone the project, open the solution in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/vs2022/) and follow these steps:

- In the **API** folder, copy `local.settings.example.json` to `local.settings.json`
- Press **F5** to launch both the client application and the Functions API app. In Visual Studio, you can right click the solution and select both API project and client project as startup projects. 

_Note: If you're using the Azure Functions CLI tools, refer to [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Ccsharp%2Cbash) on how to enable CORS._

## Template Structure

- **Client**: The Blazor WebAssembly sample application
- **API**: A C# Azure Functions API, which the Blazor application will call
- **Shared**: A C# class library with a shared data model between the Blazor and Functions application

## Deploy to Azure Static Web Apps 

This application can be deployed to [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps), to learn how, check out [our quickstart guide](https://aka.ms/blazor-swa/quickstart).


The image below was part of an assignment that required to create an Azure project. The function of this was to click counter a couple times then the user can fetch data to view the weather forcast with different dates, temperatures in either fahrenheit or celsius, and a summary of what the temperature feels like depending on temperature. An example would be on the first row it describes the tempature as cold with the given temperatures.

The second image prompts the user to enter a number and it multipled by two.

The third image prompts the user to enter either a numerical value or letter(s).
